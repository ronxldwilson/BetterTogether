    When it comes to mental health, resilience doesn’t necessarily mean you will spring back into shape. It could also mean you picked yourself up and helped yourself attain a slightly different shape, one that supports and aids your mental well-being. Think of it more like pottery. Every time the clay falls or breaks in the potter’s hands, it is their choice to go back and start moulding that same piece of clay into something beautiful. And that is resilience. <br/> <br/>
      
    You may not go back to how you were, but you should always be ready to transform yourself. I found myself reinventing and reshaping my life for a long long time, but sitting here now, writing this blog, is proof that I didn’t give up. I didn’t let the cracks define me- I let them become part of my design. <br/><br/> <p> `,

    title: 'The Role of Community in Mental Health Recovery',
    content: `The very thing that once had the power to deeply wound me eventually became my greatest source of strength and support. That’s the role community played in my mental health recovery. When I first started experiencing evident symptoms, I noticed the hush-hush’s and boo-hoo’s that surround mental health. And trust me when I say this, the people who played no role in your life until that moment will suddenly turn into important characters with very “insightful” suggestions. But you know, I hold no hard feelings whatsoever. I believe they were only unaware and uninformed about the severity of mental health and the impact their words had on our lives. `,

That’s the role community played in my mental health recovery. When I first started experiencing evident symptoms, I noticed the hush-hush’s and boo-hoo’s that surround mental health.

But you know, I hold no hard feelings whatsoever. I believe they were only unaware and uninformed about the severity of mental health and the impact their words had on our lives. <br/><br/>

    Either way, I somehow managed to find my way out of my struggles with only a few bumps and bruises thanks to this very community. Among the noise, I found a handful of people who, like me, were searching for validation, support, and empathy. Once we found each other, we shared comfort in the simple truth that we weren’t alone. Every time I felt like there was no hope, I would find myself being comforted by MY community.<br/><br/>

    Now when I say my community, I don’t mean the whole world. I mean the people who chose to stand by me and support me when things did not look too green. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: don’t hand the steering wheel of your life to strangers. Instead, let those who truly care steer for you on days when you can’t find the strength. Take comfort in knowing that they are your people. Allow them to help. Let the very thing that once scared you become your greatest strength and shield. <br/><br/></p>`,
